Welcome to our repository where we store code and figures for the **ENAR DataFest**.

## The question

Controlling blood pressure (BP) reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease. However, the prevalence of BP control (i.e., systolic BP > 140 and diastolic BP > 90) among US adults with hypertension has been declining in the past two decades from 1999 - 2020. From the NHANES data, we aim to find the importance factors that related with risk of hypertension, and whether the influencial factors differs across different age groups

## The objectives

1. Merge data from additional NHANES sources
2. Clean and transform dataset for analysis  
3. Perform statistical analyses (simple logistic regression, XGBoost modeling for age subgroups)  
4. Identify high risk factors related with specific subgroups
5. Provide descriptive analyses for the result
